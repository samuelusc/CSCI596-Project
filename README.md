# Movie Recommendation System: <br>
### ‚Äî Web App with Advanced Computing Method
<br>
## Introduction
The primary goal is to develop a robust Movie Recommendation System that provides users with personalized movie recommendation based on their previous movie rating and movie reference. The system will consist of a user-friendly frontend for interaction and a powerful backend for processing and generating recommendations.

## Dataset:
[MovieLens 20M Dataset](https://msnews.github.io/): <br>
The MovieLens Dataset is a collection of movie ratings provided by the GroupLens Research Project at the University of Minnesota. It's primarily used for research in collaborative filtering, machine learning, and data mining.<br>
[Netflix Prize Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data): <br>
The Netflix Prize dataset was a famous dataset released by Netflix for a competition to improve the accuracy of their movie recommendation system.
